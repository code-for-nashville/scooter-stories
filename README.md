# Scooter Stories
These "data stories" were created by C4N volunteers in collaboration with [Nashville Public Radio].

We hope these stories inform and engage the public in a conversation about scooters.
The city plans to pick three companies in 2019 (Q4) who will be allowed to operate scooters in Nashville.
So, we believe this is a great time to be looking at the data and discussing it as a community.
